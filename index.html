        Ayrton Senna da Silva (1960–1994) was a Brazilian Formula One driver widely regarded 
        as one of the greatest and most naturally gifted racing drivers in the history of the sport. 
        A three-time Formula One World Champion, Senna was known for his incredible qualifying pace, 
        fearless driving in the rain, and deep devotion to his craft. His tragic passing at the 1994 
        San Marino Grand Prix marked a turning point in F1 safety and left a lasting legacy on the sport 
        and millions of fans worldwide.
